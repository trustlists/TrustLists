"Atrios","https://www.atrios.com","https://www.atrios.com/privacy","Vanta","CNAME","Atrios is building the world’s largest “who knows who” data set for GTM teams.

The Wedge: Warm introductions. Scalable, automated, and incentivized.
 Cash printing machine that wins us data while creating the world's largest decentralized salesforce. (Making hundreds of intros a month right now at an average price of $1,000/intro)


The Data Layer: Over time, Atrios builds the most valuable dataset in B2B: a living graph of relationships, context, and trust signals.


How The Wedge Works:
Companies upload lead lists + bounties they will pay for meetings.
Atrios AI identifies connectors with the right relationships, plus why the intro makes sense.
Connectors earn thousands of dollars by introducing people in their network to companies/products they’ll actually value.


TL;DR: Cold outreach is broken. Warm intros are just the start. 
Atrios is building the relationship data layer that will power the next generation of sales and GTM."

"Blank","https://www.theblankapp.com/","https://www.theblankapp.com/privacy","SafeBase","CNAME","AI is the most powerful creative tool ever invented—but using it today is a total nightmare.

Your average user doesn't care which model is being used, what LoRA's are, or have patience to deal with Discord slash commands or complex designs. 

What the last 20 years of social media have taught us is that users want an easy way to create, discover, and share amazing content with friends. 

We’re also quickly learning that the models aren’t the moat. The real value lies in the consumer app that can make AI engaging, social, and accessible to everyone. 

And that’s exactly what we’re here to do. 

Blank makes creating with AI effortless, social, and fun. We package powerful new technologies in a familiar and approachable UI, making AI accessible to anyone."
