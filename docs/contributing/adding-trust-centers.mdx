## Adding New Trust Centers

There are several ways to add trust centers to TrustLists:

## Method 1: Manual Addition via GitHub

### Step 1: Find the Trust Center URL

Look for the company's trust center page. Common patterns include:
- `company.com/security`
- `company.com/compliance` 
- `company.com/trust`
- `trust.company.com`
- `security.company.com`

### Step 2: Create Registry File

Create a new file in `constants/trustCenterRegistry/` following this format:

```javascript
export default {
  "name": "Company Name",
  "website": "https://company.com/",
  "trustCenter": "https://company.com/security",
  "platform": "Self-hosted", // Will be auto-detected if omitted
  "iconUrl": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=company.com&sz=128"
};
```

### Step 3: Submit Pull Request

1. Create a new branch
2. Add your registry file
3. Submit a pull request

## Method 2: Automated Discovery

TrustLists runs automated discovery weekly to find new trust centers from YC companies. High-confidence findings are automatically added via pull requests.

## Method 3: Use the Submit Form

Visit [trustlists.org/submit](https://trustlists.org/submit) to submit a trust center through our web form.

## Platform Detection

When you add a trust center, the platform will be automatically detected based on:

- **CNAME resolution** (e.g., `cname.vantatrust.com` → Vanta)
- **URL patterns** (e.g., `company.drata.com` → Drata)
- **Domain analysis** (e.g., `trust.company.com` → Self-hosted)

## Quality Guidelines

### Required Information
- ✅ Company name
- ✅ Company website URL
- ✅ Trust center URL
- ✅ Favicon URL (auto-generated)

### URL Requirements
- ✅ Trust center must be publicly accessible
- ✅ Must contain security/compliance information
- ✅ Must be the primary trust center (not a sub-page)
- ✅ Company website should be the main domain

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Login-required pages
- ❌ Generic company websites
- ❌ Marketing pages without security info
- ❌ Duplicate entries
