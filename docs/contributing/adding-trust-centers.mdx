## Adding New Trust Centers

There are several ways to add trust centers to TrustLists:

## Method 1: Manual Addition via GitHub

### Step 1: Find the Trust Center URL

Look for the company's trust center page. Common patterns include:
- `company.com/security`
- `company.com/compliance` 
- `company.com/trust`
- `trust.company.com`
- `security.company.com`

### Step 2: Create Registry File

Create a new file in `constants/trustCenterRegistry/` following this format:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  name: "Company Name",
  url: "https://company.com/security",
  description: "Brief description of the company and their trust center",
  // Platform will be auto-detected
};
```

### Step 3: Submit Pull Request

1. Create a new branch
2. Add your registry file
3. Submit a pull request

## Method 2: Automated Discovery

TrustLists runs automated discovery weekly to find new trust centers from YC companies. High-confidence findings are automatically added via pull requests.

## Method 3: Use the Submit Form

Visit [trustlists.org/submit](https://trustlists.org/submit) to submit a trust center through our web form.

## Platform Detection

When you add a trust center, the platform will be automatically detected based on:

- **CNAME resolution** (e.g., `cname.vantatrust.com` → Vanta)
- **URL patterns** (e.g., `company.drata.com` → Drata)
- **Domain analysis** (e.g., `trust.company.com` → Self-hosted)

## Quality Guidelines

### Required Information
- ✅ Company name
- ✅ Trust center URL
- ✅ Brief description

### URL Requirements
- ✅ Must be publicly accessible
- ✅ Must contain security/compliance information
- ✅ Must be the primary trust center (not a sub-page)

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Login-required pages
- ❌ Generic company websites
- ❌ Marketing pages without security info
- ❌ Duplicate entries
